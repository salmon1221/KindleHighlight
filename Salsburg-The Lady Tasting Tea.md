## Highlights
In the long run, the statistician who always computes 95 percent confidence intervals will find that the true value of the parameter lies within the computed interval 95 percent of the time. — location: [1828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=1828) ^ref-33515

---
Note that, to Neyman, the probability associated with the confidence interval was not the probability that we are correct. It was the frequency of correct statements that a statistician who uses his method will make in the long run. — location: [1829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=1829) ^ref-16628

You cannot prove anything without a randomized experimental design, said Fisher. Some things do not lend themselves to such designs, but the accumulation of evidence should prove the case, said Cornfield. — location: [2765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=2765) ^ref-63497

Many women were working in the field, but they were almost all employed in doing the detailed calculations needed for statistical analysis, and were indeed called “computers.” — location: [2808](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=2808) ^ref-20292

In the 1950s, Richard Bellman produced a set of theorems, which he called “the curse of dimensionality.” What these theorems say is that, as the dimension of the space increases, it becomes less and less possible to get good estimates of parameters. Once the analyst is out in ten- to twenty-dimensional space, it is not possible to detect anything with less than hundreds of thousands of observations. — location: [3192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3192) ^ref-25114

---
The data actually tend to bunch up into lower dimensions. Imagine a scatter of points in three dimensions that really all lie on a single plane or even on a single line. — location: [3197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3197) ^ref-13457

---
This is because so many of the measurements are correlated with each other. — location: [3199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3199) ^ref-33735

at least in medicine, the true “dimensionality” of data is often no more than five.) — location: [3200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3200) ^ref-11930

“It is better to have an approximate answer to the right question than an exact answer to the wrong one.” — location: [3238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3238) ^ref-10991

---
Can we find methods for examining these vast collections of numbers and learn something from them without imposing assumptions about their distributions? In some sense, this is what good scientists have always done. — location: [3266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3266) ^ref-31768

---
“Numbers do not lie, but they have the propensity to tell the truth with intent to deceive.” — location: [3270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3270) ^ref-59183

The human being is prone to seeing patterns and will often see patterns where only random noise exists. — location: [3272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3272) ^ref-31347

---
The Princeton Robustness Study sought a solution that would do two things: 1. Downgrade the influence of contaminating measurements if they are there. 2. Produce correct answers if the measurements have not been contaminated. — location: [3423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3423) ^ref-48376

It was in connection with this that I began to realize how impossible it is to find human beings without biases, without prejudices, and without the delightful idiosyncrasies which make them so fascinating … . We all have prejudices about certain numbers, letters, or colours, and all of us are very superstitious. We all behave irrationally. — location: [3630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3630) ^ref-45595

---
I think that some of my major contributions as a statistician were when I discouraged others from attempting an experiment that was doomed to failure for lack of adequate resources. — location: [3679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3679) ^ref-13746

We have seen how Levy (along with Lindeberg in Finland) in the early 1930s finally proved the central limit theorem and determined the conditions necessary for it to hold. In doing so, Levy started with the formula for the normal distribution and worked backward, asking what were the unique properties of this distribution that would make it rise out of so many situations. — location: [3739](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3739) ^ref-16296

---
Levy then approached the problem from the other direction, asking what was it about specific situations that led to the normal distribution. — location: [3742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3742) ^ref-3198

1. The variability has to be bounded so individual values do not become infinitely large or small. 2. The best estimate of the next number is the value of the last number. — location: [3747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3747) ^ref-28800

---
In the first chapter of this book, I pointed out that scientific and mathematical research is seldom done alone. The abstractions of mathematical statistics are so involved that it is easy to make mistakes. Only by discussion and criticism among colleagues can many of these mistakes be found. — location: [3769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=3769) ^ref-31079

---
Over a hundred years ago, Karl Pearson proposed that all observations arise from probability distributions and that the purpose of science is to estimate the parameters of those distributions. Before that, the world of science believed that the universe followed laws, like Newton’s laws of motion, and that any apparent variations in what was observed were due to errors. — location: [4009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4009) ^ref-22132

---
many of the techniques of analysis that were examined years ago in Biometrika or the Annals of Mathematical Statistics are being rediscovered. — location: [4059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4059) ^ref-14893

With Thomas Kuhn, I do not believe that the human mind is capable of organizing a structure of ideas that can come even close to describing what is really out there. — location: [4081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4081) ^ref-9247

We can expect the statistical revolution will eventually run its course and be replaced by something else. — location: [4084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4084) ^ref-20204

Philosophy looks at the underlying assumptions behind our day-to-day cultural ideas and activities. — location: [4088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4088) ^ref-51386

Our worldview, which we learn from our culture, is governed by subtle assumptions. — location: [4088](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4088) ^ref-6354

In logic, there is a clear difference between a proposition that is true and one that is false. — location: [4132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4132) ^ref-37971

---
But probability introduces the idea that some propositions are probably or almost true. — location: [4133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4133) ^ref-21041

This extra measure, the quality of the study, is used to determine which studies will dominate in the conclusions. — location: [4136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4136) ^ref-5993

---
The concept of quality of a study is a vague one and not easily calculated. The paradox remains, eating at the heart of statistical methods. Will this worm of inconsistency require a new revolution in the twenty-first century? — location: [4137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4137) ^ref-29899

All significance tests can be run with permutation tests on the computer, as long as the data result from a randomized controlled experiment. — location: [4162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4162) ^ref-58794

Under the Savage-de Finetti approach, personal probability is unique to each person. — location: [4193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4193) ^ref-24937

---
To Keynes, probability was the measure of uncertainty that all people with a given cultural education would apply to a given situation. Probability was the result of one’s culture, not just of one’s inner, gut feeling. — location: [4199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4199) ^ref-55362

---
In this way, two of the solutions to the problem of the meaning of probability rest on the general human desire to quantify uncertainty, or at least to do so in a rough fashion. — location: [4207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4207) ^ref-50347

---
This makes for a view of probability that might provide the foundations for decision making with statistical models. This is the view that probability is not based on a space of events but that probabilities as numbers are generated out of the personal feelings of the people involved. — location: [4212](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00633W4A2&location=4212) ^ref-41445
