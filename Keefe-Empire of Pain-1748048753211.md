## Highlights
Following the conference, some of the doctors in attendance issued a joint statement on their findings. It said, “Morphine is the safest and best drug for the control of severe chronic pain.” — location: [3295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=3295) ^ref-38520

---
Prior to the launch of the drug, they had conducted focus groups in which doctors expressed concerns about the potentially addictive properties of strong opioids. But the sales reps were issued explicit instructions to challenge such concerns. — location: [3842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=3842) ^ref-34217

In some parts of Appalachia, people would pair an OxyContin with a Valium—one of Richard Sackler’s pills and one of his uncle Arthur’s. They called this “the Cadillac high.” — location: [4166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4166) ^ref-55178

---
It is a peculiar hallmark of the American economy that you can produce a dangerous product and effectively off-load any legal liability for whatever destruction that product may cause by pointing to the individual responsibility of the consumer. — location: [4247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4247) ^ref-25070

---
There were a number of problems with this hypothesis, but the most significant flaw was that not everyone who developed a problem with OxyContin started out as a recreational abuser. — location: [4250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4250) ^ref-46128

---
In fact, many people who were prescribed the drug for legitimate pain conditions and took it precisely as the doctor ordered found that they, too, had become hopelessly addicted. — location: [4251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4251) ^ref-14484

---
the very government officials whose job it was to regulate the company and hold it to account ended up seduced by a new job at the company itself. — location: [4585](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4585) ^ref-29018

---
This was a tactic that had been pioneered by the fossil fuel industry, to very successful effect—funding groups that appeared to be grassroots organizations but that actually were awash in corporate money; — location: [4608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4608) ^ref-32449

---
Just as it had with Martha West, Purdue took an individual who had raised legitimate questions about the company’s conduct and sought to smear her as unstable, unreliable, a drug abuser. — location: [4684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4684) ^ref-839

---
Udell discussed bringing a libel action against the Sentinel, suggesting that he had a “virtually ironclad case for actual malice.” Instead, Purdue pushed for, and ultimately received, a major retraction from the paper. — location: [4710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4710) ^ref-50714

“I do not believe most drug abusers are nefarious criminals,” Wettlaufer replied, “and I’m sure when you aren’t so pissed, you don’t either.” Such people have lives that “are far more difficult to cope with than ours,” Wettlaufer pointed out. “They deserve pity.” Just the same, he assured Richard, “You are doing NOTHING WRONG. That’s what counts…Deep breaths Richard. You will get through this with your humanity intact. In the final hour, it’s all you have anyway.” — location: [4743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4743) ^ref-45325

---
“Don’t make that bet,” Richard replied. Addicts want to be addicted, he proclaimed. “They get themselves addicted over and over again.” — location: [4753](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4753) ^ref-4871

There was a moment of confusion, when Brownlee had to explain to Comey that this was a case against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and not Perdue Farms, the chicken processing concern. When he had cleared that up, Comey said, “Go back to Virginia and do your case.” He didn’t need to hear the full briefing. — location: [4899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=4899) ^ref-32063

---
“Purdue Pharma acknowledged in the court proceeding today that ‘with the intent to defraud or mislead,’ it marketed and promoted OxyContin as a drug that was less addictive, less subject to abuse and less likely to cause other narcotic side effects than other pain medications,” Meier wrote in the Times. But the subtext of his dispatch was clear: I told you so. Fuck you. — location: [5175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=5175) ^ref-42769

“Those three guys basically took the hit for the family, because the family was going to take care of them,” Gary Ritchie, who spent eleven years at Purdue as a chemist, recalled. “ ‘Keep yourself out of prison; we’ll take care of you off the books.’ — location: [5250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=5250) ^ref-18122

Not long after the guilty plea, the Sacklers voted to pay Michael Friedman $3 million. Howard Udell got $5 million. The dynamics in play resembled nothing so much as a Mafia film. As one friend of Goldenheim’s put it, the three men had been designated to “take the fall.” — location: [5252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=5252) ^ref-61701

---
The book was published by the putatively independent American Pain Foundation (“A United Voice of Hope and Power over Pain”). Only in the fine print, on the copyright page, did it acknowledge the “generous support” of Purdue Pharma. — location: [5446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=5446) ^ref-17358

The opioid crisis is, among other things, a parable about the awesome capability of private industry to subvert public institutions. — location: [6677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=6677) ^ref-31145

A lot of Americans got addicted to OxyContin, Krishnamoorthi said. “I would submit, sir, that you and your family are addicted to money.” — location: [7938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=7938) ^ref-31588

even though anyone with even a passing knowledge of how journalism works would know that he would need my agreement for such a condition, and that unilateral pronouncements are meaningless, even in bold type. — location: [8108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=8108) ^ref-48785

I wondered if, for some of these people, it was just too demoralizing to take a sober measure of their own complicity, if it was simply too much for the human conscience to bear. — location: [8137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=8137) ^ref-7065

We reached an ornamental wooden gate, beyond which was a yard dominated by a stately weeping willow. As I was admiring the tree, Jeff said that for the people who maintained the grounds, it was “a pain in the ass.” Whenever the wind picks up, he explained, branches break and scatter all over the lawn. “But the place has to be flawless,” he said. “There can’t be a leaf on the ground.” So a crew would sweep through regularly, to clear away the mess. — location: [8159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ND91K6G&location=8159) ^ref-16354
