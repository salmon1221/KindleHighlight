# Atomic Habits
## Metadata
* Author: [[Clear, James]]

## Highlights
The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. — location: [182]() ^ref-57865

---
What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. — location: [241]() ^ref-63680

---
We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. — location: [254]() ^ref-11683

---
Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. — location: [255]() ^ref-36990

---
But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. — location: [257]() ^ref-44511

---
It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. — location: [259]() ^ref-41048

---
That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. — location: [266]() ^ref-28839

---
You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. — location: [268]() ^ref-54913

---
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. — location: [271]() ^ref-8962

---
You get what you repeat. — location: [273]() ^ref-39909

---
Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. — location: [294]() ^ref-18757

---
Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. — location: [305]() ^ref-13421

---
In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment — location: [306]() ^ref-54938

---
Mastery requires patience. — location: [321]() ^ref-44342

---
We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. — location: [327]() ^ref-19101

---
FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD — location: [336]() ^ref-47793

---
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. — location: [343]() ^ref-38705

---
When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. — location: [369]() ^ref-60082

---
You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. — location: [376]() ^ref-17732

---
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. — location: [385]() ^ref-58532

---
Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. — location: [491]() ^ref-39742

---
behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” — location: [587]() ^ref-376

---
The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward — location: [626]() ^ref-29727

---
We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. — location: [909]() ^ref-28940

---
When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed. — location: [910]() ^ref-4411

---
Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. — location: [911]() ^ref-48022

---
Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. — location: [928]() ^ref-21710

---
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking — location: [935]() ^ref-49549

---
Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. — location: [937]() ^ref-29103

---
Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. — location: [967]() ^ref-25454

---
In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). — location: [1027]() ^ref-6559

---
When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses with a friend. — location: [1164]() ^ref-58835

---
Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. — location: [1179]() ^ref-846

---
One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. — location: [1184]() ^ref-28341

---
The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped. — location: [1283]() ^ref-63688

---
When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. — location: [1292]() ^ref-12686

---
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. — location: [1296]() ^ref-5902

---
Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward — location: [1297]() ^ref-12192

---
We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. — location: [1318]() ^ref-27597

---
Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. — location: [1325]() ^ref-51670

---
And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find. — location: [1390]() ^ref-3043

---
One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. — location: [1426]() ^ref-45588

---
Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. — location: [1431]() ^ref-1972

---
The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps. — location: [1466]() ^ref-32952

---
Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion. — location: [1807]() ^ref-25315

---
The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. — location: [1811]() ^ref-12065

---
Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” — location: [1846]() ^ref-60996

---
Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do. — location: [1848]() ^ref-31723

---
Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments — location: [1877]() ^ref-13412

---
The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule , which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” — location: [1893]() ^ref-32170

---
The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. — location: [1898]() ^ref-52747

---
What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path. — location: [1901]() ^ref-27873

---
As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. — location: [1923]() ^ref-26246

---
The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. — location: [1925]() ^ref-64201

---
At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. — location: [1948]() ^ref-12850

---
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. — location: [2146]() ^ref-59751

---
What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. — location: [2162]() ^ref-54333

---
But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction. — location: [2166]() ^ref-23875

---
What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. — location: [2206]() ^ref-6318

---
First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. — location: [2320]() ^ref-11529

---
Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day. — location: [2322]() ^ref-36163

---
Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. — location: [2324]() ^ref-53006

---
It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten. — location: [2324]() ^ref-31083

---
Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. — location: [2337]() ^ref-64925

---
If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. — location: [2338]() ^ref-3176

---
The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. — location: [2340]() ^ref-6710

---
You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” — location: [2346]() ^ref-30577

---
The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are using a habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing. — location: [2354]() ^ref-16690

---
This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “ When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system. — location: [2369]() ^ref-31726

---
But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. — location: [2373]() ^ref-28651

---
Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. — location: [2385]() ^ref-40836

---
The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. — location: [2526]() ^ref-40804

---
Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law. — location: [2580]() ^ref-45118
