## Highlights
The direct result of all this lunacy is a perpetual treadmill race to nowhere, endlessly pounding after pleasure, endlessly fleeing from pain, and endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. Then we wonder why life tastes so flat. In the final analysis this system does not work. — location: [132]() ^ref-35514

---
You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion. You can learn not to want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them. — location: [163]() ^ref-14340

---
You want something, but you don’t need to chase after it. You fear something, but you don’t need to stand there quaking in your boots. This sort of mental cultivation is very difficult. It takes years. — location: [166]() ^ref-62967

---
Mental cultivation through meditation is without rival in helping you achieve this sort of understanding and serene happiness. — location: [185]() ^ref-42537

“What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. The consequences of an evil mind will follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls it. The consequences of a purified mind will follow you like your own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own purified mind — no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness.” — location: [187]() ^ref-55083

---
In the same way, morality is not a ritualistic obedience to a code of behavior imposed by an external authority.

There are deeper ways to understand things than by the use of words. — location: [270]() ^ref-56592

---
Meditation is not a mindless formula that gives automatic and predictable results; you can never really predict exactly what will come up during any particular session. It is an investigation and an experiment, an adventure every time. — location: [273]() ^ref-44777

---
Learning to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is essential in vipassana meditation. — location: [276]() ^ref-6634

The practice must be approached with this attitude: “Never mind what I have been taught. Forget about theories and prejudices and stereotypes. I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life, and I don’t want to just accept somebody else’s explanation. I want to see it for myself.” — location: [438]() ^ref-11562

---
The irony of it is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing it — another catch-22. — location: [460]() ^ref-27557

---
One of the things he said to his followers was, “Place no head above your own.” By this he meant, don’t just accept somebody else’s word. See for yourself. — location: [468]() ^ref-34416

---
However, if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness and without resenting the tension arising from breathing in and out, and experience only the impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of our breath, our mind becomes peaceful and calm. — location: [836]() ^ref-43965

---
an erect posture is very important. This is what is known in physiology as a position of arousal, and with it goes mental alertness. — location: [869]() ^ref-33485

Don’t think about your problems during your practice. Push them aside very gently. Take a break from all that worrying and planning. Let your meditation be a complete vacation. Trust yourself, trust your own ability to deal with these issues later, using the energy and freshness of mind that you built up during your meditation. Trust yourself this way and it will actually occur. — location: [1039]() ^ref-20053

---
This meditation is a process of retraining the mind. The state you are aiming for is one in which you are totally aware of everything that is happening in your own perceptual universe, exactly the way it happens, exactly when it is happening; total, unbroken awareness in present time. This is an incredibly high goal, and not to be reached all at once. — location: [1054]() ^ref-61433

---
Handling pain is a two-stage process. First, get rid of the pain, if possible, or at least get rid of it as much as possible. Then, if some pain lingers, use it as an object of meditation. — location: [1352]() ^ref-59980

---
Slouching will never be comfortable, so straighten up. Don’t be tight or rigid, but do keep your spine erect. — location: [1360]() ^ref-4449

---
Relax your arms and your neck muscles. Don’t let your head droop forward. Keep it up and aligned with the rest of the spine. — location: [1362]() ^ref-15266

If that is the case, try step two. Make the pain your object of meditation. — location: [1364]() ^ref-51424

---
Distractions are really paper tigers. They have no power of their own. They need to be fed constantly, or else they die. If you refuse to feed them by your own fear, anger, and greed, they fade. — location: [1686]() ^ref-1364

---

---
Your relation to sensation should never be one of past or future but always of the simple and immediate now. — location: [1805]() ^ref-54797
