# Mindfulness in Plain English
## Metadata
* Author: [[Gunaratana, Bhante]]

## Highlights
The direct result of all this lunacy is a perpetual treadmill race to nowhere, endlessly pounding after pleasure, endlessly fleeing from pain, and endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. Then we wonder why life tastes so flat. In the final analysis this system does not work. — location: [132]() ^ref-35514

---
You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion. You can learn not to want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them. — location: [163]() ^ref-14340

---
You want something, but you don’t need to chase after it. You fear something, but you don’t need to stand there quaking in your boots. This sort of mental cultivation is very difficult. It takes years. — location: [166]() ^ref-62967

---
Mental cultivation through meditation is without rival in helping you achieve this sort of understanding and serene happiness. — location: [185]() ^ref-42537

---
“What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. The consequences of an evil mind will follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls it. The consequences of a purified mind will follow you like your own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own purified mind — no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness.” — location: [187]() ^ref-55083

---
An accomplished meditator has achieved a profound understanding of life, and he or she inevitably relates to the world with a deep and uncritical love. — location: [204]() ^ref-59049

---
The meaning of faith here is closer to confidence. It is knowing that something is true because you have seen it work, because you have observed that very thing within yourself. — location: [211]() ^ref-61512

---
In the same way, morality is not a ritualistic obedience to a code of behavior imposed by an external authority. It is rather a healthy habit pattern that you have consciously and voluntarily chosen to impose upon yourself because you recognize its superiority to your present behavior. — location: [212]() ^ref-46653

---
Vipassana meditation is a profound religious practice aimed at nothing less than the purification and transformation of your everyday life. We will deal more thoroughly with the differences between concentration and insight in chapter 14. — location: [254]() ^ref-64350

There are deeper ways to understand things than by the use of words. — location: [270]() ^ref-56592

Meditation is not a mindless formula that gives automatic and predictable results; you can never really predict exactly what will come up during any particular session. It is an investigation and an experiment, an adventure every time. — location: [273]() ^ref-44777

Learning to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is essential in vipassana meditation. — location: [276]() ^ref-6634

The practice must be approached with this attitude: “Never mind what I have been taught. Forget about theories and prejudices and stereotypes. I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life, and I don’t want to just accept somebody else’s explanation. I want to see it for myself.” — location: [438]() ^ref-11562

---
The irony of it is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing it — another catch-22. — location: [460]() ^ref-27557

---
One of the things he said to his followers was, “Place no head above your own.” By this he meant, don’t just accept somebody else’s word. See for yourself. — location: [468]() ^ref-34416

---
However, if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness and without resenting the tension arising from breathing in and out, and experience only the impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness, and selflessness of our breath, our mind becomes peaceful and calm. — location: [836]() ^ref-43965

an erect posture is very important. This is what is known in physiology as a position of arousal, and with it goes mental alertness. — location: [869]() ^ref-33485

The Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha’s original discourse on mindfulness, specifically says that one must begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note all other physical and mental phenomena that arise. — location: [920]() ^ref-45863

---
Don’t think about your problems during your practice. Push them aside very gently. Take a break from all that worrying and planning. Let your meditation be a complete vacation. Trust yourself, trust your own ability to deal with these issues later, using the energy and freshness of mind that you built up during your meditation. Trust yourself this way and it will actually occur. — location: [1039]() ^ref-20053

---
This meditation is a process of retraining the mind. The state you are aiming for is one in which you are totally aware of everything that is happening in your own perceptual universe, exactly the way it happens, exactly when it is happening; total, unbroken awareness in present time. This is an incredibly high goal, and not to be reached all at once. — location: [1054]() ^ref-61433

Your urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten; but they really carry no stick at all. — location: [1165]() ^ref-30195

Greed and hatred are the prime manifestations of the ego process. — location: [1213]() ^ref-19203

Buddhism advises you not to implant feelings that you don’t really have or avoid feelings that you do have. — location: [1326]() ^ref-46170

If you are miserable you are miserable; that is the reality, that is what is happening, so confront that. — location: [1327]() ^ref-54051

---
Handling pain is a two-stage process. First, get rid of the pain, if possible, or at least get rid of it as much as possible. Then, if some pain lingers, use it as an object of meditation. — location: [1352]() ^ref-59980

---
Slouching will never be comfortable, so straighten up. Don’t be tight or rigid, but do keep your spine erect. — location: [1360]() ^ref-4449

---
Relax your arms and your neck muscles. Don’t let your head droop forward. Keep it up and aligned with the rest of the spine. — location: [1362]() ^ref-15266

---
If that is the case, try step two. Make the pain your object of meditation. — location: [1364]() ^ref-51424

---
The first is the simple sensation — pain itself. Second is your resistance to that sensation. — location: [1368]() ^ref-39209

---
Distractions are really paper tigers. They have no power of their own. They need to be fed constantly, or else they die. If you refuse to feed them by your own fear, anger, and greed, they fade. — location: [1686]() ^ref-1364

Our goal is to reach the perfection of all the noble and wholesome qualities latent in our subconscious mind. This goal has five elements to it: purification of mind, overcoming sorrow and lamentation, overcoming pain and grief, treading the right path leading to attainment of eternal peace, and attaining happiness by following that path. — location: [685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=685) ^ref-39369

The rejection is a wordless “I don’t like this feeling” or “go away” attitude. It is very subtle. But it is there, and you can find it if you really look. Locate it and relax that, too. — location: [1372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1372) ^ref-58144

If you are very sleepy, then take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Then breathe out slowly. Take another deep breath again, hold it as long as you can, and breathe out slowly.

Another influential factor is your own emotional state. If there is some real conflict in your life, that agitation will carry over into meditation. — location: [1433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1433) ^ref-30771

Mindfulness is never boring. Look again. Don’t assume that you know what breath is. Don’t take it for granted that you have already seen everything there is to see. If you do, you are conceptualizing the process. — location: [1449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1449) ^ref-1254

Remember, thoughts arise first in the unconscious. The emotional contents of a thought complex often leak through into your conscious awareness long before the thought itself surfaces. — location: [1458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1458) ^ref-64179

We humans are great at repressing things. Rather than confronting some unpleasant thought we experience, we try to bury it so we won’t have to deal with the issue. — location: [1477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1477) ^ref-19947

lot. You will find that agitation is actually rather a superficial mental state. It is inherently ephemeral. It comes and it goes. It has no real grip on you at all. — location: [1486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1486) ^ref-47526

---
A sense of failure is only another ephemeral emotional reaction. If you get involved, it feeds on your energy and it grows. If you simply stand aside and watch it, it passes away. — location: [1509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1509) ^ref-55068

We want you to move away from thinking, back to a direct, wordless, and nonconceptual experience of the breath. — location: [1649](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1649) ^ref-62860

Our three questions, “What is it? How strong is it? And, how long does it last?” are a clever remedy for this particular malady. — location: [1658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1658) ^ref-17270

Distractions are really paper tigers. They have no power of their own. They need to be fed constantly, or else they die. If you refuse to feed them by your own fear, anger, and greed, they fade. — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1686) ^ref-1364

---
Whatever you call it, that unsettled feeling is there as a definable characteristic. Look for it. Once you have spotted it, note how much of it is present. Note when it arises. Watch how long it lasts, and see when it fades away. Then return your attention to the breath. — location: [1737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1737) ^ref-11531

A pure unobstructed awareness of this event will experience it simply as a flowing pattern of energy and nothing more. No thought and no rejection. Just energy. — location: [1783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1783) ^ref-6271

In developing mindfulness, however, we temporarily suspend the conceptualization process and focus on the pure nature of mental phenomena. During meditation we are seeking to experience the mind at the preconceptual level. — location: [1787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1787) ^ref-2474

If you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When you then become aware that you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is mindfulness. — location: [1905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1905) ^ref-60662

It is observing how it affects others. In mindfulness, one is an unbiased observer whose sole job is to keep track of the constantly passing show of the universe within. — location: [1917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1917) ^ref-23915

Mindfulness is a presymbolic function. You can play with word symbols all day long and you will never pin it down completely. We can never fully express what it is. However, we can say what it does. — location: [1930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1930) ^ref-34679

---
There are three fundamental activities of mindfulness. We can use these activities as functional definitions of the term: (a) mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed to be doing, (b) it sees things as they really are, and (c) it sees the true nature of all phenomena. Let’s examine these definitions in greater detail. — location: [1933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1933) ^ref-29057

Repeated practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental habit that then carries over into the rest of your life. — location: [1939](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=1939) ^ref-13547

Concentration is often called one-pointedness of mind. It consists of forcing the mind to remain on one static point. Please note the word force. — location: [2028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2028) ^ref-23152

Mindfulness, on the other hand, is a delicate function leading to refined sensibilities. — location: [2031](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2031) ^ref-24466

Mindfulness is the sensitive one. It notices things. Concentration provides the power. It keeps the attention pinned down to one item. — location: [2032](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2032) ^ref-1297

---
Mindfulness picks the objects of attention, and notices when the attention has gone astray. Concentration does the actual work of holding the attention steady on that chosen object. — location: [2033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2033) ^ref-51117

Mindfulness is cultivated by constantly pulling yourself back to a state of awareness, gently, gently, gently. — location: [2073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2073) ^ref-31327

---
Mindfulness is the manager of the operation. Concentration furnishes the power by which mindfulness can penetrate into the deepest level of mind. Their cooperation results in insight and understanding. These must be cultivated together in a balanced manner. — location: [2100](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003XF1LKW&location=2100) ^ref-25199
