## Highlights
From the scrofulous hobos of Samuel Beckett to Antonioni’s tired-blooded aristocrats, the anti-heroes of modern art endlessly suggest that waiting for God is futile, since life is without meaning. — location: [39](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=39) ^ref-52994

“I find it’s perfectly possible to spend my life knowing that we will never explain the universe.” Jesuit Theologian John Courtney Murray points to another variety of unbelief: the atheism of distraction, people who are just “too damn busy” to worry about God at all. — location: [45](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=45) ^ref-9089

---
In this new Christianity, the watchword is witness: Protestant faith now means not intellectual acceptance of an ancient confession, but open commitment—perhaps best symbolized in the U.S. by the civil rights movement—to eradicating the evil and inequality that beset the world. — location: [52](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=52) ^ref-26503

---
Christianity, by imposing its faith on the art, politics and even economics of a culture, unconsciously made God part of that culture—and when the world changed, belief in this God was undermined. — location: [127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=127) ^ref-11466

---
“the loosing of the world from religious and quasi-religious understandings of itself, the dispelling of all closed world views, the breaking of all supernatural myths and sacred symbols.” — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=136) ^ref-10157

---
Slowly but surely, it dawned on men that they did not need God to explain, govern or justify certain areas of life. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=137) ^ref-39379

But the most important agent in the secularizing process was science. — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=146) ^ref-45584

When he was asked by Napoleon why there was no mention of God in his new book about the stars, the French astronomer Laplace coolly answered: “I had no need of the hypothesis.” — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=149) ^ref-26698

Ministers have found that currently there is no easier way to boost Sunday attendance than to post “Is God Dead?” as the topic of their next sermon. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=179) ^ref-6874

“Faith in God is more than an intellectual belief,” says Dr. John Macquarrie of Union Theological Seminary. “It is a total attitude of the self.” — location: [184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=184) ^ref-30272

To Ian Ramsey of Oxford, this area of ultimate concern offers what he calls “discernment situations”—events that can be the occasion for insight, for awareness of something beyond man. — location: [236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=236) ^ref-29768

---
It is during these insight situations, Ramsey says, that the universe “comes alive, declares some transcendence, and to which we respond by ourselves coming alive and finding another dimension.” — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HHI04OO&location=237) ^ref-39828
