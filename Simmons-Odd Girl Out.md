In a culture that denies the anger and meanness girls visit upon one another, it is incumbent upon you as a parent to validate your child’s version of events. — location: [4380]() ^ref-13780

As psychologist Madeline Levine has shown in her book The Price of Privilege, adolescents whose parents deprived them of opportunities to be self-reliant were unable to handle the challenges of adolescence. These teenagers had high levels of anxiety and depression. — location: [4387]() ^ref-27351

Just as a strong feeling like anger can be a sign that something is wrong within ourselves, a friend’s failure to listen or respond with compassion is an important signal that a relationship may not be healthy. — location: [4448]() ^ref-8521

I suddenly became conscious of how often I avoided being directly angry with people, how much I held things in and acted cold or quiet while my resentment grew. — location: [4770]() ^ref-14240

When girls shut each other down, they seal the fate of their own socialization. They tell each other that anger is indeed wrong, that they do not deserve to feel it. — location: [4789]() ^ref-35542

In 2000, UCLA researchers identified sex differences in the human response to immediate danger. Where males opted for “fight or flight,” females would “tend and befriend,” often nurturing or seeking the support of others rather than attempting to aggress or escape. — location: [1410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1410) ^ref-57066

Because these girls lack the tools to deal with everyday feelings of anger, hurt, betrayal, and jealousy, their feelings stew and fester before boiling to the surface and unleashing torrents of rage. — location: [1428](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1428) ^ref-40267

Michelle celebrated that no one would have to be afraid of Erin any longer. She might have added that no one would have to be afraid of conflict and anger, either. — location: [1620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1620) ^ref-22361

Erin’s fear of her new friends’ anger is echoed in different degrees by many survivors of bullying. These girls described feeling unfamiliar with the most basic rules of relationship, things taken for granted by any socially adjusted person. They no longer feel certain of what makes people angry or upset, not to mention how to tell when someone is feeling that way. — location: [1632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1632) ^ref-58855

Friendships in the online habitat have become yet another item to measure oneself against—like bodies, boyfriends, and grades—and so another painful source of jealousy, insecurity, and anxiety among girls. — location: [1683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1683) ^ref-7122

In a recent study, Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin, founders of the Cyberbullying Research Center, found that 84 percent of cyberbullying targets reported being bullied by someone they knew, such as a friend, ex friend, former romantic partner, or classmate. Less than 7 percent of youth in this same study reported being cyberbullied by a stranger. (The rest did not know who was bullying them.) — location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1686) ^ref-62361

But social media involves at least two discrete sets of skills: the ability to manipulate the gadgets, and the capacity to interact safely and responsibly. — location: [1694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1694) ^ref-57756

Several studies have found significant gender differences in cyberbullying. Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin of the Cyberbullying Research Center found that 26 percent of girls were targets of cyberbullying, compared to 16 percent of boys. — location: [1745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1745) ^ref-16975

Another study found that girls are nearly twice as likely as boys to have rumors spread about them online. — location: [1747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1747) ^ref-13687

Both targets and aggressors show significantly lower self-esteem than peers who are not involved in cyberbullying. — location: [1749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1749) ^ref-54117

When something is in writing, no matter its content, it becomes strangely believable, especially to the recipient. The written word carries the suggestion of gravity and truth. Kelsey explained, — location: [1792](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1792) ^ref-16249

A typical middle-class American girl sits at her laptop, chatting as the phone by her side vibrates with new messages (often while she’s doing her homework). This balancing act requires a new kind of social expertise. It takes time, and it takes access. — location: [1909](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1909) ^ref-52354

This is why girls claim they “don’t exist” if they lack a Facebook account. — location: [1911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1911) ^ref-37441

A 2010 study by the Girl Scouts found that girls downplayed their confidence, kindness, and talents online in favor of highlighting how fun, funny, and cool they were. — location: [1925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1925) ^ref-8311

Unlike real life, the true self is more easily hidden online. — location: [1930](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=1930) ^ref-33326

Needless to say, it is a toxic, self-reinforcing cycle: If you are that desperate to know what your peers think, you probably lack the self-esteem to define your own value. The more you look outside of yourself for self-worth, by visiting the website, the more personal authority and confidence you give up. — location: [2111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2111) ^ref-18369

Girls live in a social universe where truth is shielded and conflict is avoided. — location: [2114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2114) ^ref-30349

But Formspring invites people to be cruel without owning up, and users exaggerate, attack, and lie just because they can. — location: [2115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2115) ^ref-63640

They experiment with others’ feelings as a game, just to see how they react. When there is no cost and no consequence to speech, people take leave of their ethics and good sense. — location: [2116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2116) ^ref-1336

Just as girls agonize over whether they are thin or pretty enough, many worry they are not sexy or liked by boys. While girls have long lived in a culture inundated with heterosexual imagery, these messages have grown louder and more destructive. — location: [2206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2206) ^ref-7558

These “relationships” cannot ultimately fulfill her, and technology cannot be a substitute for relationship. Of her hundreds of friends on Facebook, Erin says, “I can look at a picture. It’s like, yes, you’re friends with all these people but you’re not really friends with them, so I guess that makes you realize you’re, like, very alone.” — location: [2251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2251) ^ref-34217

---
If there is now a seamless integration of girls’ online and virtual lives, there remains a split between what girls do online and who they are in real life. — location: [2259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2259) ^ref-8601

---
The question becomes whether or not we should view girls’ on-line behavior as a courageous or creative extension of their personalities, or an unattainable fantasy of who they wish they could be. — location: [2260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2260) ^ref-29516

---
Technology may speed up relationship, but it will delay authentic connection. Ironically, like water that changes to steam, the drive to avoid conflict in real life may simply create much more of it online. — location: [2271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2271) ^ref-39405

And yet. The message that modesty and restraint are the essence of femininity persists. Contemporary feminist research shows that our culture continues to pressure girls to be chaste, quiet, thin, and giving, denying the desire for sexual pleasure, voice, food, and self- interest.47 — location: [2327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2327) ^ref-23648

‘We’re just playing with you,’” Stephanie told me. “‘Don’t be so uptight.’ ‘Don’t be such a tight ass.’” — location: [2404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2404) ^ref-57089

---
In spite of the legion definitions of “all that,” there is one bottom line. There are rules, and the girl who thinks she’s all that breaks them. They are the rules of femininity: girls must be modest, self-abnegating, and demure; girls must be nice and put others before themselves; girls get power by who likes them, who approves, who they know, but not by their own hand. — location: [2468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2468) ^ref-7102

---
The culture of indirection reflects a desire to have it both ways—to give girls the world but keep them on a leash. It is yes, but: yes, you may be anything you want, but only if you don’t stray beyond the parameters of what is acceptable. Yes, girls can compete and win, but only while being modest, self-abnegating, and demure. Go too far, tip the scales, even without meaning to or knowing it, and you may be the next girl who thinks she’s all that. — location: [2484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2484) ^ref-33882

---
Competition suggests a desire to be better than others. Competition and winning are about denying others what you wish to take for yourself. — location: [2527](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2527) ^ref-49791

Girls are loosely aware of the way feeling jealous violates the expectation that they must be both perfect and self-sacrificing. — location: [2538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2538) ^ref-12234

“All that” is the hub of a hidden code that allows girls to displace feelings of competition, jealousy, anger, and desire. — location: [2545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2545) ^ref-59234

It is not her sexual behavior that earns ire, but her departure from the norms of feminine sexual modesty. — location: [2580](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2580) ^ref-42023

As Lyn Mikel Brown observed in her study of girls’ anger, “a ‘slut’ is not someone who is sexually active per se, but rather someone who is disconnected from her partner or from other girls.” — location: [2583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2583) ^ref-24385

Instead, they found, the “good girl” must put herself down, and so wind her way to the compliment she is seeking. — location: [2604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2604) ^ref-27177

And if girls can never be sure who they are supposed to be, they will play out their (and our) anxieties on each other, policing themselves into the ground, punishing and bullying and fighting to know the answer for themselves. — location: [2704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2704) ^ref-12567

Research indicates that girls who are victimized are significantly more likely to become bullies themselves. — location: [2869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2869) ^ref-16655

Indeed, memories of being the odd girl out figured prominently in the stories of girls willing to identify themselves to me as bullies or mean. — location: [2871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2871) ^ref-48094

In other words, they bullied because they felt threatened, because in their minds there was no other choice. — location: [2873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2873) ^ref-34212

Looking back at that time, she said, “I felt like there were so many people above me, to know that there was someone below me was comforting.” — location: [2915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2915) ^ref-7000

Danielle, a sophomore at Linden, met me over lunch to tell me about how controlling she was of two girlfriends between third and seventh grade. She struggled to describe her behavior. “I don’t know how to . . . explain it,” she said haltingly. “I wanted to control them and who they hung out with. I wanted to make sure they were never closer to the other girls than I was. And that they never did stuff with them when I wasn’t there.” — location: [2951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2951) ^ref-5359

---
As the fear of isolation has fueled some girls’ decisions to stay in bad friendships, here it inspired Danielle’s controlling behavior. — location: [2973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=2973) ^ref-31602

If girls were going to such great lengths to hide their aggression, they’d hardly be breaking down my door to talk about it. — location: [3036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3036) ^ref-42216

“Mean” undermines the core of the feminine identity: to be nice, to nurture, to say yes. — location: [3038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3038) ^ref-24850

---
I can see things more clearly now. I can remember girls widely acknowledged to be bullies, girls whose multiple targets had interviewed individually with me for hours, who assure me that, “When I get angry, I’ll read my Bible” or “When I’m mad, I’ll get sad. It doesn’t feel good to be angry.” I waited for a disclosure that would never come. — location: [3041](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3041) ^ref-20356

---
I couldn’t put my finger on it, but eventually I knew: I couldn’t deliver the demon. There was no evil child here, no bad apple. These girls were good people who had done bad things, and for understandable, if not good, reasons. They were not the cold, cunning creatures girl bullies are so often made out to be. — location: [3052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3052) ^ref-33570

The upshot is that it’s transformed “us against them” into “us against us.” — location: [3056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3056) ^ref-20507

---
I have—we deprive alternative aggressions of a fair hearing and ourselves of a more honest sisterhood, because to put it out there would mean we have to admit to ourselves that inside we are all mean, that inside we are all aggressive. And girlfriends, we are. — location: [3061](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3061) ^ref-19088

When we hide natural feelings of competition, jealousy, anger, and resentment, we lie to each other and ourselves. — location: [3069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3069) ^ref-55499

Our culture has made truth telling and anger, indeed, everything that is “not nice,” feel very wrong to girls. — location: [3093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3093) ^ref-1131

As Brown and Gilligan have shown us, it is critical that girls learn how to expose their most uncomfortable feelings to “the air and the light of relationship.” — location: [3094](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3094) ^ref-21315

With relationships in constant flux, girls pressure peers to evaluate their friendships, their looks, their personalities. Emily’s friend presided over a weekly ritual in which she seated their clique in a secret circle and gave each girl a grade out of one hundred. — location: [3139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3139) ^ref-12075

Sometimes I just try and brush it off, but I really can’t, and I have that feeling that you know, it’s gonna end soon, our friendship. We never had a fight, and then all of a sudden, she’s in another crowd, she doesn’t care about me anymore. We stopped talking, it’s finished.” — location: [3207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3207) ^ref-44414

Haley echoed the remarks of so many girls: the feeling of “being crazy,” of not being able to know for sure the realness of one’s own feelings or version of events in the world. — location: [3217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3217) ^ref-18702

The impulse of some girls to cling to a damaged relationship at any cost demands our attention. Its link to the trials of bullying remains largely unexplored. — location: [3282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3282) ^ref-18360

When popular girls talk about their social lives, many of them talk about losing themselves. Their feelings closely mirror the symptoms psychologists associate with girls’ loss of self-esteem. — location: [3389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3389) ^ref-8511

“It kind of feels good because I’m like included, but then again I know these aren’t the best friends for me,” she explained. Here Corinna echoes the observations of Lyn Mikel Brown and Carol Gilligan: she has sacrificed her connection to her true feelings in order to remain in less authentic relationships with others.63 In the process, she becomes disconnected from herself. “I belong but I don’t belong,” she continued. — location: [3397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3397) ^ref-39850

“Even among those who feel more free to express their anger, power, or sexual interest,” write Jill McLean Taylor and her colleagues, “the overriding move is to ‘stay to myself,’ ‘not talk to anybody,’ ‘keep my feelings bottled up,’ and ‘not tell anybody about anything.’”70 Long-term isolation can impede cognitive and emotional development. — location: [3538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003WJQ7CG&location=3538) ^ref-42067

Such marked differences in parenting practices distinguish the socialization of some black girls in at least two important ways from many of their white, middle-class counterparts.
