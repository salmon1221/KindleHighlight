# You Are Not So Smart Why You Have Too Many Frie...
## Metadata
* Author: [[McRaney, David]]

## Highlights
You are always of two minds at any one moment—the higher-level rational self and the lower-level emotional self. — location: [229]() ^ref-21539

---
Just remember, you are most open to suggestion when your mental cruise control is on or when you find yourself in unfamiliar circumstances. — location: [307]() ^ref-30044

---
If you neglect your personal space and allow chaos and clutter to creep in, it will affect you, and perhaps encourage further neglect. — location: [309]() ^ref-57919

---
Positive feedback loops should improve your life, not detract from it. — location: [310]() ^ref-26690

---
But the big picture is a lie, nurtured by your constant and unconscious confabulation, adding up to a story of who you are, what you have done, and why. — location: [343]() ^ref-35091

---
In these and many other studies the subjects never said they didn’t know why they felt and acted as they did. Not knowing why didn’t confuse them; they instead found justification for their thoughts, feelings, and actions and moved on, unaware of the machinery of their minds. — location: [470]() ^ref-15283

---
Who you think you are is sort of like a movie based on true events, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The details may be embellished, but the big picture, the general idea, is probably a good story worth hearing about. — location: [474]() ^ref-39931

---
Anywhere people are searching for meaning, you will see the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. — location: [659]() ^ref-24490

---
Look outside. See that tree? The chances of it growing there on that spot, on this planet, circling this star, in this galaxy, among the billions of galaxies in the known universe, are so incredibly small it seems to have meaning, but that meaning is only a figment of your imagination. — location: [663]() ^ref-37102

---
There is a 100 percent chance something will be there, be anywhere, when you look; only the need for meaning changes how you feel about what you see. — location: [667]() ^ref-41520

---
admit the messy slog of chaos, disorder, and random chance rules your life, rules the universe itself, is a painful conceit. — location: [669]() ^ref-11813

---
You see patterns everywhere, but some of them are formed by chance and mean nothing. Against the noisy background of probability things are bound to line up from time to time for no reason at all. It’s just how the math works out. Recognizing this is an important part of ignoring coincidences when they don’t matter and realizing what has real meaning for you on this planet, in this epoch. — location: [676]() ^ref-10421

---
THE TRUTH: Procrastination is fueled by weakness in the face of impulse and a failure to think about thinking. — location: [683]() ^ref-36004

---
When you are making plans, your better angels point to the nourishing choices, but in the moment you go for what tastes good. — location: [705]() ^ref-51182

---
This is sometimes called present bias—being unable to grasp that what you want will change over time, and what you want now isn’t the same thing you will want later. — location: [707]() ^ref-55315

---
Thinking about thinking—this is the key. In the struggle between should versus want, some people have figured out something crucial: Want never goes away. Procrastination is all about choosing want over should because you don’t have a plan for those times when you can expect to be tempted. — location: [743]() ^ref-50179

---
In addition, you are terrible at choosing between now and later. Later is a murky place where anything could go wrong. — location: [746]() ^ref-9509

---
If you fail to believe you will procrastinate or become idealistic about how awesome you are at working hard and managing your time, you never develop a strategy for outmaneuvering your own weakness. — location: [776]() ^ref-15745

---
THE TRUTH: You depend on emotions to tell you if something is good or bad, greatly overestimate rewards, and tend to stick to your first impressions. — location: [1776]() ^ref-1343

---
Logically, risks and benefits are two different things and must be judged separately, but you don’t judge things logically. The more something seems to benefit you, the less risky it seems overall. — location: [1889]() ^ref-27528

---
Remember your tendency to rush to judgment and stick with first impressions when someone is obviously playing up the positive side of an issue or begins to use euphemistic language. — location: [1894]() ^ref-50749

---
Any familiar danger will overshadow new threats, and first impressions are difficult to change. — location: [1896]() ^ref-17580

---
You function better in a cluster—that way everyone in that cluster is connected to one another and only certain individuals connect your cluster to other clusters. — location: [1943]() ^ref-29264

---
You can maintain a giant number of weak ties to people on Facebook, Twitter, and whatever comes next, much like you can in a giant company. Strong ties, however, require constant grooming. — location: [1952]() ^ref-52650

---
You can share videos of fainting goats with hundreds of acquaintances and thousands of followers, but you can trust a secret only with a handful of true friends. — location: [1954]() ^ref-7092

---
The illusory nature of existence will end and we will all, finally, be real. — location: [1982]() ^ref-45434

---
This brings us to the point: Competition among consumers is the turbine of capitalism. — location: [1996]() ^ref-23625

---
Back before mass production, people were often defined by their work, by their output. The things they owned usually either were things they hand made or were things other people made by hand. There was a weight, an infusion of soul, in everything a person owned, used, and lived in. — location: [2001]() ^ref-37872

---
Today everyone is a consumer and has to pick from the same selection of goods as everyone else; and because of this people now define their personalities by how good their taste is, or how clever, or how obscure, or how ironic their choices are. — location: [2003]() ^ref-35918

---
Having a dissenting opinion on movies, music, or clothes, or owning clever or obscure possessions, is the way middle-class people fight one another for status. They can’t out-consume one another because they can’t afford it, but they can out-taste one another — location: [2008]() ^ref-4071

---
The people who got angry didn’t release their anger on the punching bag—their anger was sustained by it. The group that cooled off lost their desire for vengeance — location: [2217]() ^ref-39191

---
If you think catharsis is good, you are more likely to seek it out when you get pissed. When you vent, you stay angry and are more likely to keep doing aggressive things so you can keep venting. It’s druglike, because there are brain chemicals and other behavioral reinforcements at work. If you get accustomed to blowing off steam, you become dependent on it. The more effective approach is to just stop. Take your anger off of the stove. — location: [2222]() ^ref-46558

---
If you get into an argument, or someone cuts you off in traffic, or you get called an awful name, venting will not dissipate the negative energy. It will, however, feel great. That’s the thing. Catharsis will make you feel good, but it’s an emotional hamster wheel. The emotion that led you to catharsis will still be there afterward, and if the catharsis made you feel good, you’ll seek that emotion out again in the future. — location: [2228]() ^ref-17400

---
THE TRUTH: Memories are constructed anew each time from whatever information is currently available, which makes them highly permeable to influences from the present. — location: [2235]() ^ref-57482

---
Each time you build a memory, you make it from scratch, and if much time has passed you stand a good chance of getting the details wrong. With a little influence, you might get big ones wrong. — location: [2293]() ^ref-53766

---
You put in less effort when in a group than you would if working alone on the same project. — location: [2510]() ^ref-25661

---
If you are trying to see yourself through their eyes, you will fail. — location: [2594]() ^ref-23569

---
If you are trying to communicate something complex, if you have vast knowledge of a subject and someone else does not, realize it is going to be difficult to get it across the gulf between your brain and theirs. — location: [2599]() ^ref-18994

---
THE MISCONCEPTION: If you are in a bad situation, you will do whatever you can do to escape it. THE TRUTH: If you feel like you aren’t in control of your destiny, you will give up and accept whatever situation you are in. — location: [2605]() ^ref-65222

---
If, over the course of your life, you have experienced crushing defeat or pummeling abuse or loss of control, you convince yourself over time that there is no escape, and if escape is offered, you will not act—you become a nihilist who trusts futility above optimism. — location: [2614]() ^ref-47887

---
Studies of the clinically depressed show that they often give in to defeat and stop trying. — location: [2616]() ^ref-33237

---
But depressed people will often blame themselves and assume they are stupid. — location: [2618]() ^ref-28826

---
You see events affecting your life along three gradients: personal, permanent, and pervasive. — location: [2619]() ^ref-16583

---
If you blame yourself or blame forces beyond your control, it hurts more. — location: [2619]() ^ref-47382

---
If you believe the situation will never change, sadness is stronger than if you believe tomorrow things will be better. — location: [2620]() ^ref-860

---
Pessimism sits on one side of the gradient and optimism on the other. The more pessimistic your explanatory style, the easier it is to slip into learned helplessness. — location: [2622]() ^ref-59619

---
When battered women, or hostages, or abused children, or longtime prisoners refuse to escape, they don’t because they have accepted the futility of trying. — location: [2625]() ^ref-29186

---
What does it matter? Those who do get out of bad situations often have a hard time committing to anything that may lead to failure. — location: [2626]() ^ref-25048

---
If you remain alone for a long time, you will decide loneliness is a fact of life and pass up opportunities to hang out with people. The loss of control in any situation can lead to this state. — location: [2628]() ^ref-11284

---
Rats suffering from cancer will die faster if placed in an inescapable situation. — location: [2632]() ^ref-13331

---
Now, with learned helplessness in full effect, you see “cinerama” differently from the now confident others with the easy word tasks. Even though it shouldn’t be too tough, learned helplessness tells you to give up. — location: [2649]() ^ref-44473

---
If you can’t escape a source of stress, it leads to more stress, and this positive feedback loop eventually triggers an automatic shutdown. — location: [2653]() ^ref-58947

---
At its most extreme, you think if you keep struggling you might die. If you stop, there is a chance the bad thing will go away. — location: [2654]() ^ref-27272

---
Choices, even small ones, can hold back the crushing weight of helplessness, but you can’t stop there. You must fight back your behavior and learn to fail with pride. Failing often is the only way to ever get the things you want out of life. Besides death, your destiny is not inescapable. You are not so smart, but you are smarter than dogs and rats. Don’t give in yet. — location: [2657]() ^ref-17941

---
THE TRUTH: Your first perception lingers in your mind, affecting later perceptions and decisions. — location: [2703]() ^ref-42145

---
In social psychology, a version of the self-fulfilling prophecy called labeling theory shows how when someone believes you are a certain kind of person, you tend to live up to those expectations. — location: [2948]() ^ref-28029

---
You react with more effort, more drive, and the positive feedback loop leads to the fulfillment of your label. — location: [2950]() ^ref-17749

---
Research shows if you believe someone is going to be an asshole, you will act hostile, thus causing them to act like an asshole. — location: [2956]() ^ref-18314

---
This same research shows if people think their partner doesn’t love them, they will interpret small slights as big hurts—and this will then lead to a feeling of rejection that causes the partner to distance him- or herself. The feedback loop will build and build until the prophecy is fulfilled. — location: [2957]() ^ref-40461

---
When it comes to belief, you are not so smart, and the things you think are true will become reality if given enough time to fester. — location: [2963]() ^ref-45006

---
If you want a better job, a better marriage, a better teacher, a better friend—you have to act as if the thing you want out of the other person is already headed your way. — location: [2964]() ^ref-3056

---
For now, it is useful to imagine there are two selves active at any given time in your head—the current self and the remembering self. — location: [2978]() ^ref-28565

---
He says the self that makes decisions in your life is usually the remembering one. — location: [2988]() ^ref-8520

---
It drags your current self around in pursuit of new memories, anticipating them based on old memories — location: [2989]() ^ref-12252

---
This is consistency bias at work: believing if you knew then what you know now, things would be different. — location: [3074]() ^ref-9751

---
But people naturally change over time. Consistency bias is the failure to admit it. — location: [3075]() ^ref-23228

---
THE TRUTH: You jump to conclusions based on how representative a person seems to be of a preconceived character type. — location: [3079]() ^ref-9101

---
For everyone else you haul around prejudices, some benign, some less so. It helps you think faster, to build models of the — location: [3086]() ^ref-38035

---
When you expect people to be a certain way because they seem to represent your notions of the sort of people in that category, you are not so smart. — location: [3131]() ^ref-13900

---
Expectation, as it turns out, is just as important as raw sensation. The buildup to an experience can completely change how you interpret the information reaching your brain from your otherwise objective senses. — location: [3163]() ^ref-5964

---
The illusion of control is a peculiar thing because it often leads to high self-esteem and a belief your destiny is yours for the making more than it really is. — location: [3284]() ^ref-6008

---
Those who are not grounded in reality, oddly enough, often achieve a lot in life simply because they believe they can and try harder than others. — location: [3290]() ^ref-1527

---
Knowing about the illusion of control shouldn’t discourage you from attempting to carve a space for yourself out of whatever field you want to tackle. After all, doing nothing guarantees no results. But as you do so, remember most of the future is unforeseeable — location: [3294]() ^ref-50875

---
Learn to coexist with chaos. Factor it into your plans. Accept that failure is always a possibility, even if you are one of the good guys; those who believe failure is not an option never plan for it. — location: [3295]() ^ref-20160

---
So seek to control the small things, the things that matter, and let them pile up into a heap of happiness. In the bigger picture, control is an illusion anyway. — location: [3299]() ^ref-26465

---
THE MISCONCEPTION: Other people’s behavior is the reflection of their personality. THE TRUTH: Other people’s behavior is more the result of the situation than their disposition. — location: [3303]() ^ref-4872

---
You see the person, and ignore his or her surroundings, and then cast blame on only the individual. — location: [3347]() ^ref-51745

---
As distressing as it may be, it is another way the fundamental attribution error drives you to jump to conclusions. You see the person, and ignore his or her surroundings, and then cast blame on only the individual. — location: [3346]() ^ref-2862

---
Psychologists know most behavior is the result of a tug-of-war between external and internal forces. People aren’t characters without nuance who can be easily predicted. — location: [3354]() ^ref-12269

---
On paper, this seems like common sense, but you easily forget about the power of the setting when judging others. — location: [3356]() ^ref-18343

---
People are not good at heart, Zimbardo says, but because their environment encourages it. Anyone, he believes, is capable of becoming a monster if given the power and opportunity. — location: [3435]() ^ref-59316

---
When you interpret your loved one’s coldness as his or her indifference to your wants and needs instead of as a reaction to stress at work or problems ricocheting in your loved one’s own heart, you’ve committed the fundamental attribution error. — location: [3437]() ^ref-3215

---
You commit it again when you assay friendliness as sexual interest, or poverty as the result of laziness. — location: [3440]() ^ref-19546

---
You blame the person, not the environment and the influence of the person’s peers. You do this because you would like to believe your own behavior comes strictly from within. — location: [3441]() ^ref-26441
