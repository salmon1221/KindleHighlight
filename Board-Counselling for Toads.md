The strongest feelings we had as children inevitably become those we regularly experience as adults. — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=574) ^ref-16817

---
‘but for most people, the very essence of growing up is to lessen and finally break those ties of dependency and become an independent and autonomous person. Few achieve this totally, some achieve it partially and many remain dependent all their lives.’ — location: [578](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=578) ^ref-38821

---
‘You had to learn how to be angry non-aggressively!’ — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=642) ^ref-34641

---
You adopted ways of letting your anger out slowly and gently, almost imperceptibly, so as not to upset anyone.’ — location: [656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=656) ^ref-21516

---
‘It means a secret agreement. I use “collude” to mean that you secretly or unknowingly cooperate with others to create your own unhappiness. And that’s why psychological games are played. And the losing is in the winning,’ — location: [780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=780) ^ref-55131

---
‘There can be no stronger criticism than self-criticism. And no harsher judge than ourselves,’ — location: [870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=870) ^ref-11814

---
Could you collude with yourself to condemn yourself? And without even knowing you were doing it, even unconsciously? — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=888) ^ref-63235

---
the trinity of the ego states. The three of them are Parent, Adult and Child and these three states describe the structure of your personality. — location: [970](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=970) ^ref-54189

---
‘The Adult Ego State’, replied Heron, ‘is the rational, unemotional way we have of behaving. It enables us to deal with the reality of what is happening in the here-and-now.’ — location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=973) ^ref-59966

---
‘The Adult Ego State is the only state in which we can learn something new about ourselves.’ — location: [982](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=982) ^ref-34852

---
‘When you are in the Parent, you are essentially being either critical or nurturing. Either way, you are repeating in words or behaviour the beliefs and values you learnt from your parents. You want to demonstrate them and tell them to others. It is a state of certainty and so there can be no place for new knowledge or ideas. The old ones reign supreme. — location: [987](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=987) ^ref-26975

---
That is why no one ever changes their mind through an argument. They simply become more entrenched in their views.’ — location: [989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=989) ^ref-36384

---
I don’t believe that anyone can make us feel anything, unless they use force and coercion. In the last analysis, we choose our own feelings. We choose to be angry or we choose to be sad.’ — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1011) ^ref-27242

---
‘The choice is this: how much longer are you going to blame other people for your own unhappiness?’ — location: [1039](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1039) ^ref-65475

---
If you take responsibility for yourself, you realise that you can take your own authority. Consequently, you realise that you have the power to change your situation and, more importantly, change yourself.’ — location: [1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1048) ^ref-1798

---
‘I was always looking for something I could excel at, something that would make people look at me and say, “Look at Toad. Isn’t he wonderful?” — location: [1187](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1187) ^ref-44543

---
Here was his life, for better or for worse, in which he was neither a great saint nor a great sinner, just Toad. — location: [1214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1214) ^ref-15317

---
The idea of life as a stage was nothing new, but it was new to think that maybe he had a ‘life-script’ which he was acting out whenever possible. — location: [1223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1223) ^ref-10780

---
But lately he had begun to realise that there might be another way of living, where instead of following a predetermined script a person might be able to live without one, making it up as he went along, so to speak. That could be quite frightening, because how would you know what to do or what to say without a script? At least this removed the problem of thinking and deciding for yourself. Without it, what would you say after you say ‘Hello’? — location: [1228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1228) ^ref-62913

---
about my script and my own personal drama. — location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1243) ^ref-62601

---
If, for instance, you believe that your life is unpleasant and unfriendly, getting drunk today is one certain way to confirm this miserable expectation tomorrow. In other words, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy’ — location: [1307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1307) ^ref-41526

---
‘Love Me No Matter What I Do. Some people make messes or get into scrapes just to see how far they can go before someone stops forgiving them or rejects them. “There you are,” they can say. “That proves that I really am that bad or that stupid.”’ — location: [1372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1372) ^ref-45469

---
‘It’s brave’, replied Heron, ‘because in selecting that position you not only make a choice, you also make a commitment. For life.’ — location: [1523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1523) ^ref-40089

---
‘I mean that being in the “I’m OK; you’re OK” position is a dynamic, not a static state. You can’t get there and say, “That’s it. I’ve arrived”, as if you have just conquered Everest. Being OK, and believing that others are, requires behaviour and attitudes which continuously demonstrate this, both to yourself and others. And it is certainly not a shelter from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.’ — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1524) ^ref-38886

---
‘It is very near to being the Humanist’s credo, a belief in oneself and others which does not require a belief in a god or the supernatural.’ — location: [1529](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1529) ^ref-17369

---
you can only fully understand yourself through getting in touch with your own emotions. — location: [1561](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1561) ^ref-34903

---
As these become clearer to you, you realise that your feelings are not optional extras that can be ignored, but they are the very centre of your self.’ — location: [1562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1562) ^ref-41417

---
‘It’s too easy’, he said, ‘to let significant events pass by without notice or celebration. Perhaps this is because we usually only recognise their importance after the event.’ — location: [1606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1606) ^ref-11631

---
‘There’s a great deal of nonsense talked about the Wide World. Of course, when you are small and have only lived in a restricted community, it can appear big and threatening. But after a bit you can find your own place in it and play a much bigger role. — location: [1767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FA622A&location=1767) ^ref-33819
