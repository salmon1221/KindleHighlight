The Fascintern, with Hitler in the driver’s seat, with Mussolini, Franco and the Japanese military cabal riding behind, emerged in 1938 as an international, revolutionary movement. — location: [53](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HDT0RX0&location=53) ^ref-29092

These multiple forms of barbarism gave shape in 1938 to an issue over which men may again, perhaps soon, shed blood: the issue of civilized liberty v. barbaric authoritarianism. — location: [64](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HDT0RX0&location=64) ^ref-32070

To this man of no trade and few interests the Great War was a welcome event which gave him some purpose in life. — location: [85](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HDT0RX0&location=85) ^ref-44170

The situation which gave rise to this demagogic, ignorant, desperate movement was inherent in the German Republic’s birth and in the craving of large sections of the politically immature German people for strong, masterful leadership. — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HDT0RX0&location=102) ^ref-10789

The “socialist” part of National Socialism might be scoffed at by hard-&-fast Marxists, but the Nazi movement nevertheless had a mass basis. The 1,500 miles of magnificent highways built, schemes for cheap cars and simple workers’ benefits, grandiose plans for rebuilding German cities made Germans burst with pride. Germans might eat many substitute foods or wear ersatz clothes but they did eat. What Adolf Hitler & Co. did to the German people in that time left civilized men and women aghast. Civil rights and liberties have disappeared. Opposition to the Nazi regime has become tantamount to suicide or worse. Free speech and free assembly are anachronisms. The reputations of the once-vaunted German centres of learning have vanished. Education has been reduced to a National Socialist catechism. — location: [120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01HDT0RX0&location=120) ^ref-22101
